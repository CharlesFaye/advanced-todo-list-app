# ✅ Advanced To-Do List App

This is a feature-rich, responsive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with filtering, sorting, and persistent storage using the browser's localStorage API.

## 🚀 Features

- Add and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or active
- Filter tasks: All | Done | Todo
- Sort tasks by:
  - Status (Completed / Not completed)
  - Alphabetical order (A–Z / Z–A)
- Save all data in `localStorage` for persistence
- Clean and accessible user interface
